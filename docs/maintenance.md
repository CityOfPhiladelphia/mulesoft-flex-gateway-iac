# Maintenance

## OS Updates

Downtime: OS updates can be performed with no downtime

1. Update AMI in launch template
    1. The automatic AMI updater runs monthly. If you need to force it, go to Github repository -> Actions -> Update AMI -> Run Workflow. This will create a pull request with the latest AMI (if it is newer than the current one)
    1. Check pull request, especially the Terraform plan, for validity
    1. Merge the pull request, then wait for the Terraform apply job to run
    1. *Note* This will not actually update or replace any servers, it just means that the next server launched will have the newer AMI.
1. Launch one new server
    1. Navigate to AWS web console -> EC2 -> Autoscaling
    1. Set the desired, minimum, and maximum capacity to one higher
1. SSH onto the new server and make sure things looks good
    1. Check `docker ps`
1. Check in the AWS target group that the new server is healthy
    1. Navigate to AWS web console -> EC2 -> Target groups
    1. The new server will typically not be healthy until 3-4 minutes. Give it time.
1. Launch more servers until you have double the usual amount.
1. Terminate the old servers
    1. Navigate to AWS web console -> EC2 -> Autoscaling
    1. Set the desired, minimum, and maximum capacity back to the original amount

## Application Updates

Downtime: Application updates likely require no downtime

There is nowhere in the Mulesoft documentation that it mentions you can't temporarily run multiple versions of Flex Gateway in parallel. This leads me to believe that for any upgrade, you can have a mixed state.

1. Update `flex_gateway_version` in Terraform
    1. Create a new branch in the Git repo, maybe like `update-{env}-app-{new_version}`, for example, `update-prod-app-v3-11-0`.
    1. Update `flex_gateway_version` for the proper environment, in `tf/env/{env}/main.tf`
1. Create the pull request
    1. Check the CI pipeline, especially the `terraform_plan` jobs
1. Merge the pull request, then wait for the CI/CD pipelines to finish
1. Launch one new server
    1. Navigate to AWS web console -> EC2 -> Autoscaling
    1. Set the desired, minimum, and maximum capacity to one higher
1. SSH onto the new server and make sure things looks good
    1. Check `docker ps`
    1. Make sure that the new version was downloaded properly and things look right
1. Check in the AWS target group that the new server is healthy
    1. Navigate to AWS web console -> EC2 -> Target groups
    1. The new server will typically not be healthy until 3-4 minutes. Give it time.
1. Launch more servers until you have double the usual amount.
1. Terminate the old servers
    1. Navigate to AWS web console -> EC2 -> Autoscaling
    1. Set the desired, minimum, and maximum capacity back to the original amount

## Valkey Maintenance

### OS Upgrades

Are handled automatically by AWS Elasticache

### Valkey Upgrades

Valkey upgrades are not handled by Terraform. This is because upgrading a Valkey instance doesn't cause any data loss, it just means the cache gets cleared. Although there is a `redis_engine_version` parameter, it is ignored by Terraform except for initial creation.

Minor upgrades happen automatically.

Major upgrades happen manually, follow AWS documentation.
